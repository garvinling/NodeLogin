  "readme": "# Passport-Local Mongoose\nPassport-Local Mongoose is a [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) [plugin](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html) \nthat simplifies building username and password login with [Passport](http://passportjs.org).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install passport-local-mongoose\n\nPassport-Local Mongoose does not require `passport`, `passport-local` or `mongoose` dependencies directly but expects you\nto have these dependencies installed.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Plugin Passport-Local Mongoose\nFirst you need to plugin Passport-Local Mongoose into your User schema\n\n    var mongoose = require('mongoose'),\n        Schema = mongoose.Schema,\n        passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');\n    \n    var User = new Schema({});\n    \n    User.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);\n    \n    module.exports = mongoose.model('User', User);\n\nYou're free to define your User how you like. Passport-Local Mongoose will add a username, hash and salt field to store\nthe username, the hashed password and the salt value.\n\nAdditionally Passport-Local Mongoose adds some methods to your Schema. See the API Documentation section for more details.\n\n### Configure Passport/Passport-Local\nYou should configure Passport/Passport-Local as described in [the Passport Guide](http://passportjs.org/guide/configure/).\n\nPassport-Local Mongoose supports this setup by implementing a `LocalStrategy` and serializeUser/deserializeUser functions.\n\nTo setup Passport-Local Mongoose use this code\n\n    // requires the model with Passport-Local Mongoose plugged in\n    var User = require('./models/user');\n    \n    // use static authenticate method of model in LocalStrategy\n    passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate()));\n    \n    // use static serialize and deserialize of model for passport session support\n    passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());\n    passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());\n\nMake sure that you have mongoose connected and you're done.\n\n#### Simplified Passport/Passport-Local Configuration\nStarting with version 0.2.1 passport-local-mongoose adds a helper method `createStrategy` as static method to your schema.\nThe `createStrategy` is responsible to setup passport-local `LocalStrategy` with the correct options.\n\n    var User = require('./models/user');\n    \n    // CHANGE: USE \"createStrategy\" INSTEAD OF \"authenticate\"\n    passport.use(User.createStrategy()));\n    \n    passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());\n    passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());\n\nThe reason for this functionality is that when using the `usernameField` option to specify an alternative usernameField name, \nfor example \"email\" passport-local would still expect your frontend login form to contain an input field with name \"username\"\ninstead of email. This can be configured for passport-local but this is double the work. So we got this shortcut implemented.\n\n### Options\nWhen plugging in Passport-Local Mongoose plugin additional options can be provided to configure\nthe hashing algorithm.\n\n    User.plugin(passportLocalMongoose, options);\n\nOption keys and defaults\n* saltlen: specifies the salt length in bytes. Default: 32\n* iterations: specifies the number of iterations used in pbkdf2 hashing algorithm. Default: 25000\n* keylen: specifies the length in byte of the generated key. Default: 512\n* usernameField: specifies the field name that holds the username. Defaults to 'username'. This option can be used if you want to use a different \nfield to hold the username for example \"email\".\n* saltField: specifies the field name that holds the salt value. Defaults to 'salt'.\n* hashField: specifies the field name that holds the password hash value. Defaults to 'hash'.\n* incorrectPasswordError: specifies the error message returned when the password is incorrect. Defaults to 'Incorrect password'.\n* incorrectUsernameError: specifies the error message returned when the username is incorrect. Defaults to 'Incorrect username'.\n* missingUsernameError: specifies the error message returned when the username has not been set during registration. Defaults to 'Field %s is not set'.\n* missingPasswordError: specifies the error message returned when the password has not been set during registration. Defaults to 'Password argument not set!'.\n* userExistsError: specifies the error message returned when the user already exists during registration. Defaults to 'User already exists with name %s'.\n* selectFields: specifies the fields of the model to be selected from mongodb (and stored in the session). Defaults to 'undefined' so that all fields of the model are selected.\n* usernameLowerCase: convert username field value to lower case when saving an querying. Defaults to 'false'.\n\n*Attention!* Changing any of the hashing options (saltlen, iterations or keylen) in a production environment will prevent that existing users to authenticate!\n\n### Hash Algorithm\nPassport-Local Mongoose use the pbkdf2 algorithm of the node crypto library. \n[Pbkdf2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) was choosen because platform independent \n(in contrary to bcrypt). For every user a generated salt value is saved to make\nrainbow table attacks even harder.\n\n### Examples\nFor a complete example implementing a registration, login and logout see the \n[login example](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose/tree/master/examples/login).\n\n## API Documentation\n### Instance methods\n* setPassword(password, cb) asynchronous method to set a user's password hash and salt\n* authenticate(password, cb) asynchronous method to authenticate a user instance\n\nUsing `setPassword()` will only update the document's password fields, but will not save the document.\nTo commit the changed document, remember to use Mongoose's `document.save()` after using `setPassword()`.\n\n### Static methods\n* authenticate() Generates a function that is used in Passport's LocalStrategy\n* serializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to serialize users into the session\n* deserializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to deserialize users into the session\n* register(user, password, cb) Convenience method to register a new user instance with a given password. Checks if username is unique. See [login example](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose/tree/master/examples/login).\n* findByUsername() Convenience method to find a user instance by it's unique username.\n* createStrategy() Creates a configured passport-local `LocalStrategy` instance that can be used in passport.\n",
